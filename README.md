This project was created using create-react-app and VSCode. Languages and/or frameworks involved are HTML, Javascript, CSS, and React.

<br/>
The biggest challenge was learning how to interact with an svg when converting it to a JS file to make it usable for my purpose.

<br/>
To run this app you only need to clone it and then run npm install and then once that is finished run npm start.
